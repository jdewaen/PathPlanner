\subsection{Indicator constraints}
Big M method: functional, but solvers struggle with large value of M. Low value of M -> may cause wrong behavior. Especially obvious when near vertical line. \\
Can approximate near vertical line as vertical line, but other solution is integer constraint from cplex. serves same role as big M method, but can't fail, is clearer and provides more information to solver.

\subsection{Corner cutting}
ref \cite{Richards2015}
implemented simple version
TODO: implement more complex version
compare no vs simple vs complex

\subsection{Max time}
limit execution time, allows for clean failure if it takes to long and backtrack.
\subsection{Max delta}
Allows for earlier return. Limited usefulness?

\subsection{Abs speed}


\subsection{Max speed}

\subsection{Min speed}

\subsection{Backtracking}
implement better!
