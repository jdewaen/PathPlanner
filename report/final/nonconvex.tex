Typically, the amount of integer variables is used as a metric for the difficulty of a MILP problem. The amount of integer variables determines the worst case time needed to solve the MILP problem. An integer variable is needed for every edge, for every obstacle, for every time step. Increasing the amount of time steps and obstacles also increases the time needed to solve.\\
However, the amount of integer variables does not seem to be the only factor that determines the solve time. Figure \ref{fig:benchmarks} shows three different scenarios, each with the same amount of obstacles. The time step size is $0.2s$, and in each scenario there were 30 seconds worth of time steps. The scenarios are built such that the time needed for the UAV to reach the goal position is roughly the same (between 26 and 27 seconds). As a result, each scenario has the same amount of integer variables. With 4 edges for all 5 obstacles and 150 time steps, they each have 3000 integer variables to model the obstacles alone.\\

In the Horizontal scenario, the obstacles are not in the way of the UAV. The UAV can move in a straight line from the start position to its goal. In the Diagonal scenario, two of the obstacles are slightly in the way. The UAV is forced to make slight turns near the start and end of the trajectory. However, most of the trajectory is still straight. In the Up/Down scenario, the vehicle has to slalom around every obstacle.\\
\section{Results}
\label{subsec:naive-results}

Each scenario was solved five times. Figure \ref{fig:naive-performance} shows the time needed to solve the models, as well as the score. The score is also expressed in seconds, and is the time needed for the UAV to reach the goal position when following the generated trajectory. \\
The time needed to solve these scenarios varies dramatically. The Horizontal scenario is solved consistently in just under 3 seconds. The Diagonal scenario comes in at around 20 seconds, although the 95\% confidence interval is $\pm 4.9s$. The Up/Down scenario was limited to 900s of execution time. In this time, the solver could not find the optimal trajectory, which is why the score has a confidence interval.
\section{Discussion}
\label{subsec:naive-discussion}
Intuitively, it is not surprising that the Up/Down scenario is harder to solve than the other two. A human pilot would also have more difficulties navigating the Up/Down scenario compared to the others. However, this is cannot be determined by looking a the amount of integer variables or constraints alone.\\
Problems where the trajectory requires maneuvers seem to be harder to solve. The maneuvers are necessary because there are obstacles blocking a straight approach to the goal position. This observation led me to believe that the integer variables themselves do not cause the poor performance, but the real issue is what they model: a non-convex search space.\\
The amount of integer variables determines the worst-case performance because it determines the degree to which the search space can be non-convex. An informal definition of this degree of non-convexity would be the minimum amount of (possibly overlapping) convex shapes needed to reconstruct the original shape. With a single boolean variable, you need at most 2 convex shapes. With $n$ boolean variables, at most $2^n$ convex shapes are needed. TODO: cite.\\

The degree of convexity of the open space for the Up/Down scenario is 11 as shown in Figure \ref{fig:convex-full-convexity}. For the Horizontal and Diagonal scenarios, this is 8 as shown in Figure \ref{fig:convex-diag-convexity}. There is a difference, but this still does not seem like a good explanation. The Horizontal and Diagonal scenarios have the same degree of convexity, even though there's almost an order of magnitude difference in the solve times. \\
Even though the global degree of convexity is the same for the Horizontal and Diagonal scenarios, this is not the case for the neighborhood around the trajectory. In the Horizontal scenario, the trajectory only goes through a single convex region. In the Diagonal scenario, the trajectory goes through 3 convex regions. For the Up/Down scenario, the trajectory goes through all 11 regions. I present the following hypothesis:
\begin{hyp}
The degree of non-convexity around the optimal trajectory is a better indicator of the time needed to solve a MILP trajectory planning problem than the amount of integer variables.

%\subsection{Implications for the thesis}
%\label{subsec:naive-implications}
%While I present Hyptothesis \ref{hyp:nonconvex} before my algorithm, I actually only came up with it near the end of the project when the algorithm was already completed. The development of the algorithm was based on a lot of trial and error, exploiting the ideas that work and ignoring those that do not. MILP solvers are black boxes, so it is hard to predict which ideas will work and which do not. It is not uncommon for mathematically equivalent constraints to have drastically different effects on solve time. \\
%However, near the end of the project I started to understand the behavior of the solver better. Hypothesis \ref{hyp:nonconvex} is the result of what I have learned during the project. It is what I believe to be the core reason why my algorithm is effective.
%\par
%Section \ref{section:segment} often refers back to this hypothesis to motivate certain decisions. However, the hypothesis was often not the actual motivation behind those decisions. The arguments I present in section \ref{section:segment} are the arguments I believe to be correct at the time of writing.
%\par
%Due to time constraints, this thesis does not investigate Hypothesis \ref{hyp:nonconvex}. The outcome and conclusions of this thesis do not depend on this hypothesis
