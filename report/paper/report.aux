\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1}{\ignorespaces If the velocity is limited to a finite value, the velocity vector must lie within the circle centered on the origin with the radius equal to that value. This is represented by the black circle. This circle cannot be approximated in MILP, but it can be approximated using several linear constraints. The blue square shows the approximation using 4 linear constraints. The red polygon uses 8 linear constraints. As more constraints are used, the approximation gets closer and closer to the circle. \relax }}{3}}

\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2}{\ignorespaces A visual representation of how obstacle avoidance works. The top image shows the vehicle's current position as the filled circle, with its path in previous time steps as hollow circles. The color of the edges of the obstacle represent whether or not the vehicle is in the safe zone for that edge. An edge is yellow if the vehicle is in the safe zone, and red otherwise. The middle image shows the safe zone defined by a yellow edge in yellow. Note how the vehicle is on one side of the black line and the obstacle is entirely on the other side. The bottom image shows an edge for which the vehicle is not in the safe zone (represented in red this time). As long as the vehicle is in the safe zone of at least one edge, it cannot collide with the obstacle.\relax }}{3}}
